let stringHash = "#";

for (let count = stringHash; count.length < 8; count += "#") {
	console.log(count);
}
//We create a variable in which we save the # charachter, then we initializate a for loop and we keep the count, we give the value of the stringHash variable, it's gonna run through the loop until the length of the let count reach 8 character, then we print the value that is storaged on count and finally another # is going to be added to the count let.
